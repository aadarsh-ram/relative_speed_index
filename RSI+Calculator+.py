# Relative Strength Index (RSI) 
# 
# Developed by J. Welles Wilder, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Traditionally, and according to Wilder, RSI is considered overbought when above 70 and oversold when below 30. 
# 
# There are 2 common ways of calculating Relative Strength Index. 
#     1. Using Simple Moving Average (SMA)
#     2. Using Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
# 
# The following python script aims to calculate the RSI for First Solar stock (FSLR) using both methods.
